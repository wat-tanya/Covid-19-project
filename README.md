# ü¶† COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

A data analysis project using real-world COVID-19 data to track and visualize global pandemic trends. This project focuses on analyzing cases, deaths, and vaccination progress over time across multiple countries using Python data tools.

---

## üìä Project Objectives

- Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
- Analyze time trends of cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Compare COVID-19 metrics across selected countries (Kenya, USA, India).
- Visualize pandemic trends using line charts, bar charts, and choropleth maps.
- Communicate findings through visualizations and narrative explanations.

## üí° Insights & Reflections

- **India experienced the largest spike** in daily COVID-19 cases in May 2021, aligning with the Delta variant outbreak.
- **The USA had an aggressive vaccination rollout** in early 2021 but faced stagnation later.
- **Kenya's vaccination progress was slower**, reflecting disparities in vaccine distribution.
- **Vaccination rates correlate with declines in new cases** post mid-2021, demonstrating the impact of immunization efforts.
- This project highlights the importance of data visualization in making complex pandemic data understandable and actionable.
